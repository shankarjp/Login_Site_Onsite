# Login Site

Create a site with a login form. There should be a captcha to prevent automated login. The captcha can be strings or simple
arithmetic questions. The username must be a valid NITT roll number of a current UG student. You can assume each department has 200 students per batch. The password must have uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Any username - password combination that satisfies these conditions is considered valid. Check the conditions in the backend. No need to use any DBs to check passwords.

Do not use any captcha service. Implement your own image captcha. Generate captcha in real time. Do not reuse captcha images.
